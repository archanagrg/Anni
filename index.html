                    <span>
                        &emsp; With you, love feels easy. Safe. Real. You’ve filled my world with a kind of happiness I didn’t know I was missing until you came in my life. Every laugh, every hug, every little moment with you is a memory I carry till my last day.Thank you for being my favorite part of every day.For being my calm in chaos, my reason to smile, and the one I can always count on.I still get butterflies.And I still look at you and think—how did I get so lucky?

                        &emsp; But time flies so fast hai? just like 2-3 yrs ago you loved me so much and now you just don't care how my day was. From loving me unconditionally for 6 years to disrespecting me infront of your friends. From Video calls even when you play your games in  PC to not wishing me even on my birthday. From dropping me to my hostel when its just 5pm to leaving me alone at 8pm. From comforting me when I overthink to swearing on me through text. From solving the misunderstanding to not giving a fuck. From being proud of having me in your life to hiding our relationship in social media. Ahhhh! We've come a long way right?</span>
                        <br> <br>
                        <span>
                          &emsp; I am willing to lower my ego and say sorry a million times cause I don't want to loose you but the saddest part is you've changed. It's ok if you don't love me anymore, don't care about me anymore. You're the reason I'm strong, you made me able to fight with the reality and made me believe not everything lasts forever. I wished things were same as before. I wished your love was same as before. I wished you had never changed.But, Nevermind. No matter where life takes , I hope you continue your aim and fulfill your dreams. Make mummy proud. I'm always proud of you on everything. Love you!
